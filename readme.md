## Introduction
In NYC, taxicabs come in two varieties: yellow and green; they are widely recognizable symbols of the city. Taxis painted yellow (medallion taxis) are able to pick up passengers anywhere in the five boroughs. in Upper Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten island. The yellow taxi cab was first introduced in 1915 by a car salesman named John Hertz. Hertz decided to paint his taxis yellow because of a study by a Chicago university to establish what color would grab the attention of passers-by more easily. The results proved that yellow with a touch of red was most noticeable. As a result, Hertz started to paint all his taxicabs yellow and went on to start the Chicago-based Yellow Cab Company in 1915.
